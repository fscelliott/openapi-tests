# openapi-tests

I think all I ever did with this repo was mess about with the open yml and then attempt to view it through redoc-cli or through the demo site.



it could be interesting to:



- use the HTML code sample at https://github.com/Redocly/redoc with a local file path and see if I can render image referenced in the openapi.yml. if I can..
- build my own Dockerfile for redoc and change the favicon.png for example. https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/config/docker/Dockerfile
